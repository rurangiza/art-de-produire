# Art de Produire

At this stage, this site is a high fidelity wireframe of what I want to build.
It allows me to practice as I'm learning HTML/CSS and UI/UX design.
I wanted to build it in public for accountability and motivation.
I'll add new features every week, depending on what I've learned but
the final version should have :

## V1 (basics)

- a nice dark mode and responsive design
  - home page
  - article page
  - post
- a blog
- video courses with a playlist navigation
- a podcast page (maybe)

## V2 (useful tools)

- white mode / dark mode switch
- a music glossary
- a chord and scale finder
- something with an api, not sure what yet
